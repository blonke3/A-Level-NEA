# A-Level-NEA
This is a copy of my NEA project I made for Computer Science A level in 2022-2023.

This program trains an LSTM model using classical music and then can generate music in the style of Chopin or Beethoven (albeit not very well due to training constraints...) as well as in different styles. This is all shown to the user in an intuitive user-interface which also includes a database that stores previously made music.
